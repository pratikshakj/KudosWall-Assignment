Problem statements

# 1. Write a function that takes a number and returns an array of its digits.
# 2. Write a function that translates a text to Pig Latin and back. English is translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to the end of the word, and adding "ay".  For example, "hello to kudoswall" becomes "ellohay otay udoswallkay".

# 3. Write a function that rotates an array by k elements. For example, [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2]. Try solving this without creating a copy of the array.
# 4. Write a function to alternate the case of the characters in the string; i.e., each lowercase letter becomes uppercase and each uppercase letter becomes lowercase. For example, altERnaTIng cAsE becomes ALTerNAtiNG CaSe
